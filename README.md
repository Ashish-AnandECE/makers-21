# Makers 2021
Makers tasks by SDSLabs.

Makers is an annual, one of a kind competition which lets you show off your awesome projects and ideas you make during the period of one month. You are allowed to work on your own ideas, but if you are out of one, we have curated a list of awesome ideas you can choose one from.

## Rules
There are no ground rules but one - *no plagarism*. We will invalidate the submission if we find such case. After all, this competition is for learning. Deadline for submissions: __20 March 2021 2359 Hours__.  
Double check if you are in the [SDSLabs open source discord server](https://discord.gg/jRXZp35qtN) to interact with us. Keep an eye out on the discord server for imporant announcements. We'll also be organising Mentorship Weekends here during which SDSLabs members will be available 24/7 to assist you with your projects.

## Eligibility
Any student of IIT Roorkee is eligible to make a submission and interact with us regarding their project. However, only freshers are eligible for the prizes

## Prizes
The projects made by freshers which catch our eye will earn their makers a direct interview for SDSLabs recruitment.

## Ideas
Find the ideas list for this edition of Makers [here](ideas/2021.pdf). There is no compulsion to work on an idea from this list, you're free to do anything as long as it involves making something with code.

## Submission
For a valid submission, you would be needing a source repository link, demo page (if its a web app) or executable (for native app). Make a PR to this repository, which 

1. Adds a single Markdown (`.md`) file to the folder [submissions/](submissions/). A sample submission can be viewed [here](submissions/2021/sample_rootex.md).
2. The name of the file should be unique and can contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`).

The file should contain basic information specified in the PR template, and any screenshots/media you might want to include. For making your applications live, we will provide you our own cloud hosting platform, which will make your deployments a breeze (Stay tuned for the official release :slightly_smiling_face:)

Happy hacking!
